I updated the make file to be able to compile the book, clothing, movie, and mydatastore files.
I dont think I have any oddities in my program.
I checked all the information files provided and didn't see anything about valgrind so I didn't make sure to delete the user and product pointers because they were created in the db_parser file which I was told was already completed.
Thanks!
